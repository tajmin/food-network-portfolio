                <h2>Chocolate Mousse</h2>
                <p>The best chocolate mousse must be perfect. It should taste rich, indulgent and not too sweet, with a
                    texture that is both light-and-airy and silky-and-smooth. After many attempts we nailed it and made
                    a dessert that not only exceeded our standards, it's also quite easy to pull off. </p>
